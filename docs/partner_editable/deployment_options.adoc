// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and a target host. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions an ASA bastion host in your existing AWS infrastructure. You use this bastion host to provision {partner-product-short-name} on existing target hosts.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. You can configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.
