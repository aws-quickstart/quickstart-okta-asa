.Quick Start architecture for _{partner-product-name}_ on AWS

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start deploys the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

* In the public subnets:

** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound SSH access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets. This Linux bastion host has the Okta server agent installed and shares a configuration to act as the bastion host for SSH access to the EC2 instance in the public subnet.

//TODO Dave, The previous bullet isn't clear to me. (1) Any chance the last few words should be "in the private subnet"? (2) Those two sentences are repetitive, and I don't know how to tighten them accurately. Would you take a shot?

* In the private subnets, a Linux EC2 instance (target host) in an Auto Scaling group. This target host has the Okta server agent installed and is configured to be accessible only through the Linux bastion host in the public subnet.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
