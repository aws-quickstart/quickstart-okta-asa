The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start provides a mechanism for managing the lifecycle of local EC2 instance user and group accounts and their machine-level permissions directly sourced from the https://www.okta.com/products/[Okta Identity Cloud^]. You can access Linux or Windows EC2 instances using Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Secure Shell (SSH). Access is authenticated and authorized through an Okta single sign-on workflow. This workflow can also provide contextual multifactor authentication.

By default, this Quick Start sets up SSH access to Linux EC2 instances. If you want to use RDP and Windows, you can choose those parameters during deployment.

//TODO Dave, Please verify the above sentence I added. Feel free to rephrase to make it more helpful for this audience. 

When you use Okta Advanced Server Access as your authentication mechanism to EC2 instances, you don't rely on static credentials to log in. With Okta, the credentials used to authenticate are ephemeral. This approach mitigates the risk of credential theft and misuse. It also eliminates the need to wrap additional controls and management layers around secrets.
