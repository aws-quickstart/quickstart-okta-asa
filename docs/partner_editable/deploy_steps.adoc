=== Set up {partner-product-short-name}

==== Sign in to your {partner-product-short-name} team

Sign in to your {partner-product-short-name} team at https://app.scaleft.com with your Okta credentials. If you do not have an {partner-product-short-name} team, see link:#_planning_the_deployment[Planning the deployment] earlier in this guide for instructions on how to create a tenant. 

==== Create a project

Create an {partner-product-short-name} project, which represents the authorization scope for a set of EC2 instances. Users and groups are explicitly assigned to projects, where role-based access and entitlements are specified. Okta manages and provisions accounts and entitlements to the downstream EC2 instances.

=== Launch the Quick Start

WARNING: If you're deploying {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC, make sure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances and that the subnets aren't shared. This Quick Start doesn't support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^]. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet. Also make sure that the domain name option in the DHCP options is configured as explained in http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP options sets^]. You provide your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

Each deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete.

. Sign in to your AWS account, and choose one of the following options to launch the AWS CloudFormation template. For help with choosing an option, see link:#_deployment_options[Deployment options] earlier in this guide.
